# VS Village

VS Village is an attempt to bring a village system right into Vintage Story. It introduces a wide variety of villagers, each of them with different day time routines. There are __soldiers__ who defend the village, __farmers__ who will watch the field, __shepherds__ that will take care of cattle, and a small selection of other professions. Each of these villagers will need a __workstation__ and a __place to sleep__ at night.
